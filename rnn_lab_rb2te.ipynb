    "Now to the actual training call, notice how unlike previous experiments we are using here RMSprop which is a different type of optimizer that is often preferred for recurrent neural networks, although others such as SGD, and ADAM will also work. Additionally we are using nn.NLLLoss for the loss function, which is equivalent to the nn.CrossEntropyLoss function used before. The only difference is that nn.CrossEntropyLoss does the log_softmax operation for us, however in our implementation, we already applied log_softmax to the outputs of the model."

This should be an implementation of the model in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf (See figure 3 in the paper). This model is very similar to the one implemented in this lab except that the first RNN cell gets the output of a CNN as its input. I'm also illustrating it below using a figure similar to the one in the previous question. For the CNN use Resnet-18. Note: You do not need to train this model, only define it.
